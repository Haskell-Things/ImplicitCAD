-- | The goal of getLoops is to extract loops from a list of segments.
--   The input is a list of segments.
--   The output a list of loops, where each loop is a list of 
--   segments, which each piece representing a "side".

-- For example:
-- Given points [[1,2],[5,1],[3,4,5], ... ] 
-- notice that there is a loop 1,2,3,4,5... <repeat>
-- But we give the output [ [ [1,2], [3,4,5], [5,1] ], ... ]
-- so that we have the loop, and also knowledge of how
-- the list is built (the "sides" of it).

getLoops a = getLoops' a []

-- We will be actually doing the loop extraction with
-- getLoops'

-- getLoops' has a first argument of the segments as before,
-- but a *second argument* which is the loop presently being
-- built.

-- so we begin with the "building loop" being empty.
getLoops' :: (Show a, Eq a) => [[a]] -> [[a]] -> [[[a]]]

-- | If there aren't any segments, and the "building loop" is empty, produce no loops.
getLoops' [] [] = []

-- | If the building loop is empty, stick the first segment we have onto it to give us something to build on.
getLoops' (x:xs) [] = getLoops' xs [x]

-- | A loop is finished if its start and end are the same.
-- Return it and start searching for another loop.

-- Otherwise... something is really screwed up.
